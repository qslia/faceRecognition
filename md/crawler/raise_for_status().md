This is **`response.raise_for_status()`** - a method that checks if the HTTP request was successful.

## What it does:

**`response.raise_for_status()`** checks the HTTP status code and:
- ‚úÖ **Does nothing** if the request was successful (status code 200-299)
- ‚ùå **Raises an exception** if there was an error (status code 400+)

## HTTP Status Codes:

| Status Code | Meaning | `raise_for_status()` behavior |
|-------------|---------|-------------------------------|
| 200 | OK - Success | ‚úÖ Does nothing (continues) |
| 301, 302 | Redirect | ‚úÖ Does nothing (handled automatically) |
| 400 | Bad Request | ‚ùå Raises `HTTPError` |
| 403 | Forbidden | ‚ùå Raises `HTTPError` |
| 404 | Not Found | ‚ùå Raises `HTTPError` |
| 500 | Server Error | ‚ùå Raises `HTTPError` |

## Example in your code:

```python
try:
    response = self.session.get(search_url, timeout=10)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Check if request succeeded
    
    # If we reach here, request was successful (200-299)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
    
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error searching Bing: {e}")  # Catches HTTPError
    return []
```

## Why use it?

### ‚ùå Without `raise_for_status()`:
```python
response = requests.get("https://example.com/page")
print(response.text)  # Might print error page HTML!
# Code continues even if Bing blocked you (403 Forbidden)
```

### ‚úÖ With `raise_for_status()`:
```python
response = requests.get("https://example.com/page")
response.raise_for_status()  # Raises exception if error
print(response.text)  # Only executes if request succeeded
```

## Common scenarios in web scraping:

1. **Rate limiting** (429 Too Many Requests)
   ```python
   # Bing blocks you for too many requests
   response.raise_for_status()  # Raises HTTPError
   # Caught by except block ‚Üí prints "Error searching Bing"
   ```

2. **Page not found** (404)
   ```python
   # URL doesn't exist
   response.raise_for_status()  # Raises HTTPError
   ```

3. **Access denied** (403)
   ```python
   # Bing detected it's a bot
   response.raise_for_status()  # Raises HTTPError
   ```

## Real output example:

```python
# If Bing blocks you:
requests.exceptions.HTTPError: 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: ...

# If page doesn't exist:
requests.exceptions.HTTPError: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: ...
```

## In your crawler context:

This is **essential** for web scraping because:
- Detects when Bing blocks your requests
- Prevents processing error pages as valid HTML
- Provides clear error messages in the logs
- Allows graceful error handling

**Best practice** for robust web scraping! üëç
