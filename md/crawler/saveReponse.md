The code you have is incorrect. `response.text` is a string, not an object with a `.save()` method. Here's the correct way to save it:

## Correct way to save `response.text`:

```python
# Write response.text to a file
with open("response.html", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write(response.text)
```

## Complete examples:

### Option 1: Basic (UTF-8 encoding)
```python
# Save HTML response
with open("response.html", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write(response.text)
```

### Option 2: With error handling
```python
try:
    with open("response.html", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        f.write(response.text)
    print("âœ“ Saved to response.html")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error saving file: {e}")
```

### Option 3: Save with timestamp (useful for debugging)
```python
from datetime import datetime

timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
filename = f"response_{timestamp}.html"

with open(filename, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write(response.text)
print(f"âœ“ Saved to {filename}")
```

### Option 4: In your crawler context
```python
# Inside your search_bing_images function
try:
    response = self.session.get(search_url, timeout=10)
    response.raise_for_status()
    
    # Save the HTML for debugging
    with open("bing_response.html", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        f.write(response.text)
    print("âœ“ Saved Bing response for debugging")
    
    # Parse the page
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
    # ... rest of your code
    
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

## Why use `encoding="utf-8"`?

- HTML often contains special characters (ä¸­æ–‡, emojis, etc.)
- UTF-8 handles all Unicode characters
- Without it, you might get encoding errors

## Alternative: Save raw bytes (for images)

If you want to save binary data (like images), use:

```python
# For images or binary files
with open("image.jpg", "wb") as f:
    f.write(response.content)  # Note: .content not .text
```

## Quick reference:

| What to save | Method | Mode |
|--------------|--------|------|
| HTML text | `response.text` | `"w"` |
| Image/binary | `response.content` | `"wb"` |
| JSON | `response.json()` | `"w"` |
